					“Death over Drugs"
				</h1>
				<p class="author"> By Andrei Paolo D. Mercado </p>

				<p class="one">With the number of drug users in our country today slowly increasing over time, it could ruin the population by affecting the people around them in a negative way. This caused many problems for us such as having neighborhoods with bad reputations. These could be a hotspot that would subconsciously encourage drug use. The drug abusers could potentially hurt other people in their vicinity because of drugs. Many many things could happen with the state of the country if this problem is not dealt with soon. </p>

				<p class="two">With our president despising the idea of our country having a problem with drugs, he thought of a plan that would give them the advantage in fighting this war on drugs. The plan was to have raids across the country and put a stop to drug use and drug dealing. That was at least what they wanted to do. Having raids meant that they would be endangering the lives of many people from both sides of the battle. I believe that is a good thing because it would give the people more depth to the message that they want to say.</p>
				<p class="three">Killing innocent people with the slightest relation to drugs is also a good way to combat this ongoing crisis we have in our country. It would give the government an image of being merciless and lustful for blood which would scare off other people. To support the families of those that have died due to the war on drugs, we could easily offer them with drugs to combat depression and kill them afterwards too. Having a higher death count would be better than having more people in the country still doing drugs. </p>

				<p class="four"> The drugs that would be confiscated could be sold off to other countries and have money to better equip the men that would kill people in raids in our combat with drugs. This means that we could give our problems to other countries to make us look good and have our country be one with one of the least drug users in the world. Being better equipped can lead to easier raids and more killings of both guilty and innocent people. The government would be a powerhouse to deal with and would only grow stronger.</p>
				<p class="five"> With the government growing more and more in power, the officials in high places can easily get rich just by the fear that they strike unto people by telling them that they are part of the merciless and bloodthirsty government that we have. People in power would have even more power and could easily pass on more strict laws for their own personal advantage on society. The Philippines could be another dictator based country that would strike fear on other countries and be more in control and have more power. </p>
				<p class="six">Overall, with the government having the audacity to not care about their own image and have a dark and treacherous aura around them, The country could excel faster and easily take care of drugs which is also a problem in other countries. It would benefit us in not just dealing with drugs, but also being a more prominent figure in the world.</p>
